story of my Primary school teacher
she loves to say _ogay_ 
when we say "I thought no homework."
she says , "you though who confirm?"
one day, she taught us how to control your anger by saying, "i feel angry because...i hope next time you wil...". so nat, who was angry at her for releasing us late after school, he said, "mdm goh, i feel angry becasue you release us late. i hope that in the future, you will not do it again"
6/7 is awesome yay
